# Game Basic Information #

## Summary ##

KnightQuest is a 2D platformer with simple sword combat mechanics. The goal of the game is to traverse various obstacles and platforms while attacking or avoiding various enemies. The level begins relatively straightforwardly, but increases in difficulty the further you progress in the map. The map's platforming will grow more difficult to complete, while variations to the slime enemies will make avoiding or defeating them more challenging as well. Through the map, the player will encounter deadly spikes both static and falling, disappearing platforms, exploding enemies, and moving platforms. The player wins when the finally reach the end of the level and save the captured royal family.

## Gameplay Explanation ##

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. It is encouraged to explain the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy.**

Gameplay in KnightQuest revolves around moving or jumping to traverse obstacles or avoid enemies, as well as attacking. The A and D keys are used to move left and right respectively, while the spacebar allows the player to jump. Pressing spacebar again after having jumped allows the player to jump one more time before landing. Pressing the left mouse button for fewer than 2 seconds will perform an attack, while holding for 2 or more seconds will perform a heavy attack. Pressing E performs a spin attack. When the player touches a slime, they will take damage, indicated to the player by a reduction of their health bar. Players may encounter chests that restore health when stood on. Platforming generally requires good timing to ensure that the player does not land on an enemy or fall off a platform. At certain point, players will reach checkpoints that will update where they spawn on death. 


**If you did work that should be factored in to your grade that does not fit easily into the proscribed roles, add it here! Please include links to resources and descriptions of game-related material that does not fit into roles here.**

# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least 4 such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The background of the game consists of procedurally-generated terrain that is produced with Perlin noise. This terrain can be modified by the game at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.
